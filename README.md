## Welcome to Study Bot

In the day and age of virtual learning, it can be difficult to keep focus and stay on track with studying.

With Study Bot, we want to make sure that you are most productive and efficient during your study time. 

We've implemented the famous and trusted **Pomodoro Technique** in the form of a discord bot!

## How it works


Pomodoro allows you to focus on a designated task by breaking up the amount of studying time you have, and rewarding your work with small breaks as you work.

With StudyBot, call the command ***!study*** and you will be prompted with your study session. You will be asked:
    
    1. How long is your desired study duration? 
    2. How long would you like your breaks to be?
    3. How many break sessions would you like through out your studying?

Following this, a StudyBot will send a dynamic timer, accomodating your requested study durations.

It will keep a countdown timer, with how much of your total study time is available, and alert you when it's time for a break. Once break starts, the break timer will also start and you will be alerted when it's time to go back to studying.
